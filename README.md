This is my first React Native app that I will be developing to learn React Native. 
<br>The app will take the form of a shopping list that myself and my wife can use to add items to our shopping list throughout the week as we notice them. 

MVP: 
- The app will store information in a NoSQL database which will require login to access. 
- The account will originally be for an individual shopping list that users can log into. 
- The user will be able to add, edit and delete items from the list. 
- The user will be able to see the list of items added to and can check off the items once picked up at the shop.
- Once items have been selected, a 'delete bought items' option will appear allowing users to remove items from the list while leaving items still needed.
- When adding items to the list, a drop down will appear with item names to choose from as they type
- Item icons for any name matches (e.g. a carton of milk for milk)

Stretch goal: 
- Allow separate account to access the same database if it has been shared between users.
- Favourite items option to select and add items frequently bought
- Previously bought items list to see what was bought last time
- Template list for items bought every week
- TBD
