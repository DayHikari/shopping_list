This is my first React Native app that I will be developing to learn React Native. The app will take the form of a shopping list that myself and my wife can use to add items to our shopping list throughout the week as we notice them. 
MVP: 
&emsp;- The app will store information in a NoSQL database which will require login to access. 
&emsp;- The account will original be for an individual shopping list that users can log into. 
&emsp;- The user will be able to add, edit and delete items from the list. 
&emsp;- The user will be able to see the list of items added to and can check off the items once picked up at the shop.
&emsp;- Once items have been selected, a 'delete bought items' option will appear allowing users to remove items from the list while leaving items still needed.
&emsp;- When adding items to the list, a drop down will appear with item names to choose from as they type
&emsp;- Item icons for any name matches (e.g. a carton of milk for milk)

Stretch goal: 
&emsp;- Allow separate account to access the same database if it has been shared between users.
&emsp;- Favourite items option to select and add items frequently bought
&emsp;- Previously bought items list to see what was bought last time
&emsp;- Template list for items bought every week
&emsp;- TBD
